# Reflection 2025-12-06 by Richel

I think this season went well.

The biggest changes were:

- The addition of a cooking course, as lead by Store Björn and assisted by
  Johanna
- Maturation of the Gyllene Rummet, as lead by Leonid and Herman
- No Arduino volunteer, yet more Arduino learners
- AtomBjörn upgrading the reception desk
- AtomBjörn collecting parents' phone numbers

## Course attendance

Taking the average number of learners per year,
the course seems to grow:

![Average number of learners per year](average_number_of_learners_per_year.png)

However, this growth can be explained by how attendance is measured:
if a learners takes more courses, he/she is counted multiple times.
We can conclude that **we have increased attendance over the day**.

By other means, the numbers of learners seems to have stabilized:
here we plot the distribution of the learners over the year:

![Normalized learners attendace over the yar](learners_attendance_over_the_year.png)

This graph shows when in the year, most learners are present. Where
2022 shows that most learners attend at the end of the year, this
shows a growth. Where 2024 and 2025 show that learners show up equally
over the year. This hints that **growth may have stopped**.

When looking at the last season on its own, we
see a slight decrease:

![Learners' presence in season 2 of 2025](franvaro_2025_2_n.png)

This decrease, however, seems to be most explained by the outlier
at the end. Removing it, seems to hint that **growth may have stopped**.

Taking a look at course attendence over the last season:

![Learners' presence in season 2 of 2025 per course](franvaro_2025_2_n_per_course.png)

Adding a trendline and showing the equation to get the slope:

![Learners' presence in season 2 of 2025 per course](franvaro_2025_2_n_per_course_with_stats.png)

From this, per course, we can see how many learners for a course
per month:

Course    |Change of learners per day|Change of learners per 30 days
----------|--------------------------|------------------------------
Arduino   |0.018                     |0.54
Laser     |-0.0122                   |-0.366
Roblox    |-0.0264                   |-0.792
Cooking   |-0.0309                   |-0.927
Godot     |-0.0383                   |-1.149
Processing|-0.0594                   |-1.782
Blender   |-0.0619                   |-1.857

Arduino is growing for unknown reasons. I really have no idea
what is so attractive there ...? Blender and Processing are the courses
that are taking the biggest dives. Also here, I have no idea
why this is. In summary: 
**I have no idea why the attendance of courses go up or down**.

Before deciding to take action, let's take at the bigger picture:

![Attendence per course](n_per_day_per_course.png)

The vertical scale has a big range, because of
**Efterfarsdag was a big success**.

Let's zoom in a bit on regular course attendance:

![Attendence per course](n_per_day_per_course_zoom.png)

Based on this graph, I would say
**course attendance has a high variability and seems stable**.

In conclusion, I would say that 
**attendance and course attendance have stopped growing**.
and **no action seems needed**.
