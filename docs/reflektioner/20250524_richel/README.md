# Reflection 2025-05-24 by Richel

## Previous reflection


> - Ask UMS for +30 person limit on Eftermorsdag

Done! It worked out great.

> - Presentation rule: zero or one questions

Done! This worked out great, so we'll keep this rule.

> - No evaluations after presentation. Instead, do parent evaluations
  during preparing the main room. Let learners fill in form during preparations
  too

This got postponed. Instead, we had presentations for the parents,
where the kids evaluated after the presentations as usual.
We forgot to let the kids evaluate while waiting.

## Course statistics

![Amount of learners per courses in this season](franvaro_2025_1_n_per_course.png)

Course attendance has gone down for all courses.

I feel there is no need to worry at all:
this has happened before when there was an other big change (in 2023-03-25),
where we lost a third of all learners (do note that the learners can
officially sign in for more courses since ~April.
The effect of learners doing so on the graph below is minor).

I predict we'll bounce back after the summer holidays.

## Evaluation results

Taking a look [at the evaluation results](../../data/utvaerderingar/20250524/README.md),

There were 20 evaluation forms being filled in.
The learners seemed quite happy, as a lot went well: e.g. 3x it was
states that 'allt' went well.

What could be improved, according to the learners

- More time
  - Start earlier

This will come true with the next cooking course. Maybe this learners will
also come in at 9:00 and start his/her course then already.

- More books
  - [Explain sine and cosine better in the Processing books](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/processing_foer_ungdomar/issues/8)
  - [Add a Processing lesson on how to detect a mouse click](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/processing_foer_ungdomar/issues/9)
  - [Add an Arduino lesson on a color sensor](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/arduino_foer_ungdomar/issues/8)

This is put into issues.

- More volunteers

This I cannot control.

- More courses
  - Game programming
  - Roblox
  - Java
  - Minecraft mods


- Breaks:
  - 11 minutes (instead of 15)
  - 2x Cookies
  - More pan pizzas
