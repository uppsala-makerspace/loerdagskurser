Dear funder,

I am the initiator and coordinator of the LÃ¶rdagskurser
and I could definitely use your help. With this writing,
I hope to convince you of our awesomeness and needs.

The awesomeness of our courses started in january 2022,
where I taught the first lesson to three participants,
after which we grew with around 15 participants per year.
The exact amount of vistors is publicly available at
[https://uppsala-makerspace.github.io/loerdagskurser/data/statistiker_besoekare/](https://uppsala-makerspace.github.io/loerdagskurser/data/statistiker_besoekare/),
including this plot shown below, which shows the amount of visitors in time:

![Number of learners per day](n_per_day_per_course.png)

This plot allows me to introduce what we teach:

- Arduino: a printed circuit board that can be programmed to act as the
  brain of an electrical machine
- Blender: a 3D modeling program, suitable for -among others-
  3D printing those images
- Processing: a programming language that is similar to the programming
  languages in the software development industry

The shaded area in the plot shows our success,
as it shows the total amount of participants per day.
The black dots show activities we do besides regular lessons,
such as presentation by all participants in the public library.

The mention of these presentations allow me to introduce our anonymous
evaluation we do after each of these. Here, our participants fill
in a form anonymously to help improve our courses.
These evaluation results are all publicly available at
