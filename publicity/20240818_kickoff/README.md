# Kick-off

I lead the Saturday courses.
I will share why I think these are important.
Maybe you think it is a good cause to.
For those, I will tell who can contribute on any voluntary basis.

## Course goals

> A course presentation, twice a year

- Providing a learning community:
    - learning how to do 3D modeling, electronics, programming, teaching, shape a learning community
    - making the mistakes needed in a safe environment
- Providing a first/second home
- Make the world a better place locally
    - make the next generation awesome

## My role

> A quiet start of Kulturnatten.
> At the end of the day, we'd have had around 100 guests being taught!

- end responsible
- maintain order
- administration
- scheduling
- communication with parents, UMS, Stadsbiblioteket, etc.
- talk to other volunteers
- prepare teaching materials
- teach

## Course core ideas

![](efterfarsdag.jpg)

> Efterfarsdag, where the kids teach dads

- students do everything themselves, no leaning on volunteers
- students help students
- students can be themselves when not disturbing others
- parents are always welcome, yet discouraged to be present

## Course success

## Contributing

- *student*: being an adult that follows the course already helps the course to go more smoothly. Students help each other.
  We know the kids enjoy adults from our anonymous evaluations. As an adult students, you'll make the course go more smoothly
- *teacher*: answer questions, helping to make our students autonomous learners by coaching, 1-on-1 teaching is the exception. There are
  multiple teachers and they rotate in who works when.
  As a teacher, you'll make the course be able to go deeper
- *host/hostess/trivsel/wellbeing*: students need to to be welcomed when they come and sign up on a list. They need lemonade in the breaks.
  They may need to lie down on a sofa when ill. They need to have someone to talk to when upset. As a host/hostess, you'll help the students feel more at home
- *course leader*: we teach three courses, all involving a computer. If you too think there should be more different courses
  and you'd enjoy to profit from the Lördagskurser, you're welcome to add a new course to the Lördagskurser. 
  You will have full autonomy, all I need to know is how to work together. 
  As a course leader, you'll increase the diversity of the student population
